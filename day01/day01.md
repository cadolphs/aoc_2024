# Day 01

We can just read the problem description and directly turn it into an algorithm:

1. Line up the lists -> Each needs to be sorted
2. Add up difference -> Zip them to gether, compute the difference, the sum up

Note: We could load everything into dataframes or numpy, too. Let's see what the speed is, though.

## Part 2

Here we can use an existing python collection: The Counter
