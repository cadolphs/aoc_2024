Advent of Code 2024

Not sure how much time I'll have this year, but they're always fun and I'll see if I can use them to learn about some neat new libraries. No Rust this time. Most of the time there is spent on building the input parsers and the actual algorithm part is just like what you'd do in Python anyway.
